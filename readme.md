# Library Manager

## Start

To start the Library Manager just run the ``src/main.py`` file.

After exiting the first time, a ``library.txt`` file will be created next to ``main.py``, if books have been created.\
The file contains all created books. Each line is one book with its values being comma separated.

The next time the Library Manager is started, it will load all books from the ``library.txt`` file.
